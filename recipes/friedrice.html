    <h2>Fried Rice</h2>
    <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>3 Cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 Medium Scallions</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 Cup Frozen peas and Carrots</li>
        <li>4 cups of cooked brown or white rice</li>
        <li>2 Tabelspooons soy sauce</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h3>How to Make</h3>
        <li><strong>MAKE AHEAD </strong>Cook the rice up to 1 day ahead and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Mince 3 garlic cloves. Thinly slice 2 medium scallions crosswise on a slight diagonal, keeping the white parts separate from the light and dark green parts.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a large wok or nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the garlic, scallion whites, and 1 cup frozen peas and carrots. Stir-fry until the carrots and peas are thawed, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 4 cups cold cooked rice, breaking up any clumps of rice with your fingers as you add it in. Toss to combine with the peas and carrots. Add 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 3/4 teaspoon ground white pepper. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Push the fried rice to one side of the pan. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil to the now-empty side of the pan, then crack 2 large eggs into the oil. Scramble into fluffy curds until almost set.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and stir the eggs into the fried rice, breaking up any large pieces of egg. Drizzle with 3/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil and toss to combine. Taste and season with more kosher salt and white pepper as needed. Garnish with the reserved scallion greens.</li>
    </ol>
